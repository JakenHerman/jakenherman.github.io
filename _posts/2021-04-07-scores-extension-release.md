I was very surprised to see there was no Visual Studio Code extension to do something as simple as checking scores for top sporting leagues. There did seem to be some for NBA specifically, but no MLB, NHL, or NFL from what I could tell (at the time of writing this).

So, if you want scores from top leagues in your VS Code editor, search for "Scores" in the extension marketplace:

![scores]({{ site.url }}/img/scores/scores.png)

For right now, the extension is extremely basic, does not show any other information regarding state of the game (inning/period/quarter, base situation, out situation, etc) - just the scores. I might add to it later, but as of right now I don't feel any strong desire to add more than what I already have:

![scores]({{ site.url }}/img/scores/scoreslong.png)

Enjoy!
